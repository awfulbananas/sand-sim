this file has the tooltip text for the simulation

on another note, this file format is terrible and I should fix it when I have time

probably by making it so that I don't need to add all the fields for each piece of text
so old files still parse fine, and also adding an escape character so that you can use
colons in the text

this would also mean you could use different fonts for different pieces of text, giving the format
more versatility
